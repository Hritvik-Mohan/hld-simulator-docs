Implementation guidance & suggestions
"Represent system as directed graph: 
      nodes=components, 
      edge=dependencies

      Each node has deterministic state transitions driven by events"
Use discrete-event simulation engine with deterministic random seed
"Provide a component plugin interface so new component types (e.g., specialized ML serving infra) can be added"
Model time explicitly and allow time dilation (fast-forward)
Keep observability data compact (sample trace only for key requests)
Allow multi-tenant and multi-region configuration
"Provide library of pre-built component templates (e.g., rds-postgres, kafka-cluster, redis-cluster)"
