Scenario composer (DSL) - combine primitives
Policy engine (OPA) for validating deploys)
Cost calculator (simulate provider pricing)
Impact calculator (how many users affected by component X failing)
Replay engine (replay recorded event traces)
Fuzzing harness (mutate events slightly deterministically)
Chaos scheduler (pre-program failures at deterministic times)
Comparators (A vs B design diff runner)
