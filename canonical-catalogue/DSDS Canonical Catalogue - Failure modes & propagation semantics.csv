Failure modes & propagation semantics (must model),
Cascading failures,downstream timeouts cause upstream to retry -> overload -> more timeouts
Backpressure,"queue saturate, producers should experience increased latency or block"
Resource exhaustion,"ephemeral port, file descriptors, NAT port exhaustion"
Split-brain,cluster partition causing write conflicts
Stale reads,read-after-write inconsistency due to eventual consistency
Data loss,failed commits in distributed transactions
Thundering herd,cache expiry at same time causing origin overload
Configuration drift,node runs old config causing policy mismatch
Security failures,leaked token used for privilege escalation

Simulate failure propagation deterministically: ,"define propation rules (e.e., service fails after X dependency failures or after its error rate > threshold)"
