Example deterministic scenarios to ship with the simulator
Cache stampede after TTL expiry for 1M keys; simulate origin overload.
DB primary crash during heavy writes - test loss/consistency and failover time.
Network partition between two regions with cross-region writes -> check split-brain.
Auth provider outage - failed logins cascade to other services.
Sudden traffic spike (10x) with cold start penalty for serverless.
Price surge - simulate cost impact and auto-scale mitigation.
Feature flag rollback failing halfway - simulate mixed behavior.
