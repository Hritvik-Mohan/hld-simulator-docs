Quick checklist for “include everything”

"Compute types (VM, container, serverless, batch)"

"Networking (LB, TGW, CDN, VPN)"

"Storage tiers (hot, warm, cold; object/block/file)"

"Messaging & streaming (queue, pubsub, stream, event bus)"

"Coordination (etcd, leader election, locks)"

"Security stack (WAF, IAM, Vault, KMS, CA)"

"Observability (metrics, logs, tracing, alerts)"

"Delivery & governance (CI/CD, IaC, policy-as-code)"

"Real-time & media (WebRTC, SFU, TURN, transcoders)"

"Edge & CDN (edge compute, worker scripts)"

"Integration (webhooks, third-party APIs, payment gateways)"

"Data infra (ETL, CDC, DW, feature store)"
